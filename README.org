** Some dump functional proof of concepts iun zig.

- The iterators will compile to same code as loops for ReleaseSmall,
but slightly different on ReleaseFast. 
- The context and setjmp/longjmp doesn't compile under current zig due
to prototype differences between c and zig.
- amb should work for functions that don't require non-local state to
get the correct answer once the longjmp or context stuff works.

** next on list
- [ ] generators and yield
- [ ] stupid continuation tricks around @Frame copying
